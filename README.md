# sudoku_solve
This project is a web-based Sudoku Solver developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to enter an unsolved 9×9 Sudoku puzzle and automatically finds a valid solution using a backtracking algorithm. The solver checks all Sudoku constraints, including row, column, and 3×3 subgrid rules, to ensure correctness.
